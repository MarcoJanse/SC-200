## Mitigate threats using Microsoft 365 Defender

### Introduction to Microsoft 365 threat protection

Below is a visual representation of detection and mitigation use cases

![MDE - Compromised Endpoint](images/sc-200_mde_compromised-endpoint.png)

Zoom in to MDE - suspend access during compromised phase

![MDE - Suspend access during compromise](images/sc-200_mde_suspend-access-compromise.png)

#### Security Operations Model

The following Tiers are used in a Security Operations Model

- Automation
- Tier 1: Triage
- Tier 2: Investigation
- Tier 3: Hunt

See the below graph for the tasks of each team.

![Security Operations Model](images/sc-200_security-operations-model.png)

Below is an example of an incident lifecycle

1. Triage (Tier 1) analyst claims a malware alert from the queue and investigates (for example, with Microsoft 365 Defender console) 
2. While most Triage cases are rapidly remediated and closed, this time the analyst observes that malware may require more involved/advanced remediation (for example, device isolation and cleanup). Triage escalates the case to the Investigation analyst (Tier 2), who takes lead for investigation. The Triage team has option to stay involved and learn more (Investigation team may use Microsoft Sentinel or another SIEM for broader context)
3. Investigation verifies investigation conclusions (or digs further into it) and proceeds with remediation, closes case.
4. Later, Hunt (Tier 3) may notice this case while reviewing closed incidents to scan for commonalities or anomalies worth digging into:

- Detections that may be eligible for auto-remediation
- Multiple similar incidents that may have a common root cause
- Other potential process/tool/alert improvements In one case, Tier 3 reviewed the case and found that the user had fallen for a tech scam. This detection was then flagged as a potentially higher priority alert because the scammers had managed to get admin level access on the endpoint. A higher risk exposure.

#### Alert Categories

The alert categories align with the enterprise attack tactics in the [MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/). The categories are:

- **Collection** - Locating and collecting data for exfiltration
- **Command and control** - Connecting to attacker-controlled network infrastructure to relay data or receive commands
- **Credential access** - Obtaining valid credentials to extend control over devices and other resources in the network
- **Defense evasion** - Avoiding security controls by, for example, turning off security apps, deleting implants, and running rootkits
- **Discovery** - Gathering information about important devices and resources, such as administrator computers, domain controllers, and file servers
- **Execution** - Launching attacker tools and malicious code, including RATs and backdoors
- **Exfiltration** - Extracting data from the network to an external, attacker-controlled location
- **Exploit** - Exploit code and possible exploitation activity
- **Initial access** - Gaining initial entry to the target network, usually involving password-guessing, exploits, or phishing emails
- **Lateral movement** - Moving between devices in the target network to reach critical resources or gain network persistence
- **Malware** - Backdoors, trojans, and other types of malicious code
- **Persistence** - Creating autostart extensibility points (ASEPs) to remain active and survive system restarts
- **Privilege escalation** - Obtaining higher permission levels for code by running it in the context of a privileged process or account
- **Ransomware** - Malware that encrypts files and extorts payment to restore access
- **Suspicious activity** - Atypical activity that could be malware activity or part of an attack
- **Unwanted software** - Low-reputation apps and apps that impact productivity and the user experience; detected as potentially unwanted applications (PUAs)

#### Automated investigation

When an alert is triggered, a security playbook goes into effect. Depending on the security playbook, an automated investigation can start.

##### Investigation details

- **Alerts** - The alert(s) that started the investigation
- **Devices** - The device(s) where the threat was seen.
- **Evidence** - The entities that were found to be malicious during an investigation.
- **Entities** - Details about each analyzed entity, including a determination for each entity type (Malicious, Suspicious, or No threats found).
- **Log** - The chronological, detailed view of all the investigation actions taken on the alert.
- **Pending actions** - If there are any actions awaiting approval as a result of the investigation, the Pending actions tab is displayed. On the Pending actions tab, you can approve or reject each action.

##### Remediation action: automation levels

- Full - remediate threats automatically (also referred to as full automation)
- Semi - require approval for any remediation (also referred to as semi-automation)
- Semi - require approval for non-temp folders remediation (also a type of semi-automation)

> Using the no automation option isn't recommended because it reduces the security posture of your organization's devices. Consider setting up your automation level to full automation (or at least semi-automation)

#### Advanced Hunting

Advanced hunting is a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you explore up to 30 days of raw data. You can proactively inspect events in your network to locate threat indicators and entities. The flexible access to data enables unconstrained hunting for both known and potential threats.

[Demo: advanced hunting](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE4Bp7O?postJsllMsg=true)

Time information in advanced hunting is in the UTC zone

##### Custom detections

With custom detections, you can proactively monitor for and respond to various events and system states, including suspected breach activity and misconfigured endpoints. This is made possible by customizable detection rules that automatically trigger alerts and response actions.

Custom detections work with advanced hunting, which provides a powerful, flexible query language that covers a broad set of event and system information from your network. You can set them to run at regular intervals, generating alerts and taking response actions whenever there are matches.

Custom detections provide:

- Alerts for rule-based detections built from advanced hunting queries
- Automatic response actions that apply to files and devices

#### Analyze threat analytics

Threat analytics is a threat intelligence solution from expert Microsoft security researchers. It's designed to assist security teams to be as efficient as possible while facing emerging threats, such as:

- Active threat actors and their campaigns
- Popular and new attack techniques
- Critical vulnerabilities
- Common attack surfaces
- Prevalent malware

### Protect your identites with Azure AD Identity Protection

Identity Protection is a solution built into Azure AD that's designed to protect your identities through a three-part process.
It requires Azure AD Premium P2 licenses. (included in E5 for example)

![Azure AD Identity Protection](images/sc-200-identity-protection-overview.svg)

#### Risks

Risks are categorized in two ways: as user risks and sign-in risks. User risks can be described as suspicious activity and actions by users when they sign in, and sign-in risks as actions that users take after signing in.

##### User risk

A user risk is caused when a user's identity or account is compromised. User risks can include:

| **Risk**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unusual behavior   | The account showed unusual activity or the patterns of usage are similar to those patterns that Microsoft systems and experts have identified as attacks.                   |
| Leaked credentials | The user's credentials could have been leaked. For example, Microsoft might have found a list of leaked credentials on the dark web, which could affect your user accounts. |

##### Sign-in risk

Here, Identity Protection scrutinizes each authentication request to judge whether the owner of the identity authorized it. Sign-in risks can include:

| **Risk**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unfamiliar sign-in properties | Identity Protection remembers and learns a particular user's sign-in history. For example, when a sign-in occurs from a location that's unusual for the user, a risk detection is triggered. |
| Atypical travel               | For example, when two or more sign-ins occur from distant locations in an unrealistically short time period, a risk detection is raised.                                                     |
| Malware-linked IP address     | For example, if it's known that the IP address where the sign-in originates has been in contact with an active bot server, a risk detection is raised.                                       |
| Anonymous IP address          | For example, a sign-in originates from an anonymous IP address. Because attackers can use these details to hide their real IP address or location, a risk detection is raised.               |

#### Save time with automated investigation and response

**Automated investigation and response (AIR)** capabilities include a set of security playbooks that can be launched automatically, such as when an alert is triggered, or manually, such as from a view in Explorer. AIR can save your security operations team time and effort in mitigating threats effectively and efficiently.

#### Safe Attachments

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Safe Attachments protects against unknown malware and viruses, and provides zero-day protection to safeguard your messaging system. All messages and attachments that don't have a known virus/malware signature are routed to a special environment where Microsoft Defender for Office 365 uses various machine learning and analysis techniques to detect malicious intent. If no suspicious activity is detected, the message is released for delivery to the mailbox.

#### Safe Links

The Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Safe Links feature proactively protects your users from malicious URLs in a message or in an Office document. The protection remains every time they select the link, as malicious links are dynamically blocked while good links can be accessed.

Safe Links is available for URLs in the following apps:

- Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise on Windows or Mac
- Office for the web (Word for the web, Excel for the web, PowerPoint for the web, and OneNote for the web)
- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Visio on Windows, as well as Office apps on iOS and Android devices
- Microsoft Teams channels and chats

#### Anti-phishing policies

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing checks incoming messages for indicators that a message might be a phishing attempt. When users are covered by Microsoft Defender for Office 365 policies (Safe Attachments, Safe Links, or anti-phishing), incoming messages are evaluated by multiple machine learning models that analyze messages. The appropriate action is taken, based on the configured policies.

There's no default Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing policy. When you're creating one, only targeting is originally configured. Impersonation settings play a large role in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing policies. Impersonation is where the sender or the sender's email domain in a message looks similar to a real sender or domain:

An example impersonation of the domain `contoso.com` is `Ä‡Ã³ntoso.com.`
An example impersonation of the user `michelle@contoso.com` is `michele@contoso.com.`

### Microsoft Defender for Identity

Microsoft Defender for Identity is a cloud-based security solution that leverages your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.

Therefore, you need to install an sensor agent on your DC's.
